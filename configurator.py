'''
Tool for creating configuration data, namely units and modifiers for factions.

Will be a jumping off point for the full GUI, where users can:
1. load their faction data
2. configure an "encounter"
3. run the attack sequence
4. print the results.

This tool has the following objectives:
Define weapons and armour (attack and defence characteristics)
Define models (which are a list of weapons and an armour)
Define units (which are lists of models)
Define modifiers (which are composed from a fixed list of basic modifiers)
